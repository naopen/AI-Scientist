        "Experiment": "Implement an iterative question refinement and information extraction loop in the RAG system. This process consists of the following steps:\n1. Receive the user's initial question\n2. Automatically expand and refine the question considering ESG context\n3. Perform initial information extraction using the expanded question\n4. Analyze the extraction results to identify missing information or ambiguities\n5. Generate new supplementary questions based on identified issues\n6. Perform additional information extraction using supplementary questions\n7. Integrate new information to create a more comprehensive answer\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 as necessary\nThis iterative approach enables the extraction of complex ESG information that cannot be obtained in a single pass, through gradually refined queries. The insights gained through this process can also be used to improve future question processing.",

This will facilitate easier comparison of ESG performance across different companies and industries, enabling more objective analysis. Additionally, implement functionality to track extracted indicators over time, allowing for trend analysis.",
