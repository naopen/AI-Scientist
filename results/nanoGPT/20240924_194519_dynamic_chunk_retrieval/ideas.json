        "Experiment": "Implement an iterative question refinement and information extraction loop in the RAG system. This process consists of the following steps:\n1. Receive the user's initial question\n2. Automatically expand and refine the question considering ESG context\n3. Perform initial information extraction using the expanded question\n4. Analyze the extraction results to identify missing information or ambiguities\n5. Generate new supplementary questions based on identified issues\n6. Perform additional information extraction using supplementary questions\n7. Integrate new information to create a more comprehensive answer\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 as necessary\nThis iterative approach enables the extraction of complex ESG information that cannot be obtained in a single pass, through gradually refined queries. The insights gained through this process can also be used to improve future question processing.",

        "Experiment": "Develop a feature that incorporates machine learning models into the RAG system to automatically extract and standardize ESG-related quantitative indicators (such as CO2 emissions, employee diversity ratios, etc.). This will facilitate easier comparison of ESG performance across different companies and industries, enabling more objective analysis. Additionally, implement functionality to track extracted indicators over time, allowing for trend analysis.",

        "Experiment": "Implement a feature in the developed RAG system that dynamically segments ESG documents. Automatically adjust chunk sizes based on document content and questions to retrieve context containing more relevant ESG information. This is expected to enable more accurate and relevant ESG information extraction compared to traditional fixed-length chunk segmentation.",
