    "Summary": "The paper proposes an iterative refinement method for ESG data extraction using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It introduces an adaptive query-response loop to iteratively refine queries and improve extraction accuracy.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a relevant and complex problem of ESG data extraction.",
        "Proposes an adaptive query-response loop, which could potentially enhance data extraction processes."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "The datasets used (shakespeare_char, enwik8, text8) are not relevant to ESG data, making the experimental validation unconvincing.",
        "The experimental results lack clarity and relevance to the problem statement, with zero values in training and validation losses indicating potential issues.",
        "Insufficient explanation of the adaptive query-response loop, which is central to the method.",
        "No discussion on ethical concerns or limitations specific to ESG data extraction."
    ],
    "Originality": 2,
    "Quality": 2,
    "Clarity": 2,
    "Significance": 2,
    "Questions": [
        "Why were shakespeare_char, enwik8, and text8 chosen for evaluating ESG data extraction?",
        "Can the authors provide more details on the adaptive query-response loop?",
        "How does the method address potential ethical concerns in ESG data extraction?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "The paper does not address the limitations of using non-ESG datasets for evaluation and lacks discussion on potential ethical concerns."
    ],
    "Ethical Concerns": true,
