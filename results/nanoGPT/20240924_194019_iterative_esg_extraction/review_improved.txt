{"Summary": "The paper presents a novel method for ESG data extraction using an iterative refinement process within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It introduces an adaptive query-response loop to improve extraction accuracy and comprehensiveness. However, the evaluation is conducted on non-ESG datasets, which limits the applicability of the results to real-world ESG scenarios.", "Strengths": ["Proposes a novel adaptive query-response loop within a RAG system.", "Addresses a relevant problem in ESG data extraction."], "Weaknesses": ["Uses non-ESG datasets for evaluation, undermining the relevance of results.", "Lacks empirical validation on ESG-specific datasets.", "Insufficient comparison with existing methods.", "Zero values in some experimental runs suggest potential implementation issues.", "Lacks detailed ablation studies and discussion of ethical considerations."], "Originality": 3, "Quality": 2, "Clarity": 2, "Significance": 2, "Questions": ["Why were non-ESG datasets used for evaluation, and how do these results translate to actual ESG data?", "Can the authors provide empirical results on ESG-specific datasets?", "What specific contributions does the adaptive query-response loop make to the observed improvements?", "What are the ethical considerations addressed in the method, especially concerning data privacy and bias in ESG data?"], "Limitations": ["The use of non-ESG datasets limits the applicability of the results to ESG scenarios.", "Potential implementation issues indicated by zero values in some runs need to be addressed."], "Ethical Concerns": true, "Soundness": 2, "Presentation": 2, "Contribution": 2, "Overall": 3, "Confidence": 4, "Decision": "Reject"}
